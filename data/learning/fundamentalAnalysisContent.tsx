            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Description</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">Quality of Earnings (QoE) is a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the net income figure reported on the income statement. It examines how reliable, sustainable, and transparent a company's reported profit is. QoE analysts look beyond the GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income to identify non-recurring events, aggressive accounting choices, and mismatches between accrual earnings and actual cash flow.</p>
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Deep Learning Insight</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">High-quality earnings are backed by real cash flow from core operations (CFO). Low-quality earnings often rely on non-cash items, one-time asset sales, or aggressive accruals that inflate the current period's profit at the expense of future periods. A key test is the Accruals Ratio:</p>
            <div className="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded-lg my-4 text-center">
                <code className="text-lg text-gray-700">Accruals Ratio = (Net Income - CFO) / Average Total Assets</code>
            </div>
            <p className="mb-4">A high or rapidly increasing Accruals Ratio signals that a large portion of earnings is not being converted into cash, indicating a potentially low-quality, unsustainable profit that may lead to a future write-down or restatement. Analysts must also scrutinize Discretionary Accruals like changes in warranty reserves or inventory valuation methods.</p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Description</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">Free Cash Flow (FCF) is the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support its operations and maintain its capital assets. It is calculated as: FCF = Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) - Capital Expenditures (CapEx). FCF is the true measure of a business's ability to create wealth for its shareholders.</p>
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Deep Learning Insight</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">FCF is the ultimate non-GAAP profitability metric because it is far harder to manipulate than net income. It represents the cash available for discretionary uses: paying dividends, buying back stock, reducing debt, or pursuing non-essential acquisitions. Valuation is often centered on FCF through the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. A key analysis is the FCF Yield (FCF / Market Cap), which provides an equity return rate analogous to a dividend yield but based on all free cash. A healthy company should show consistent FCF growth that outpaces Net Income growth, demonstrating superior operational efficiency and high-quality earnings.</p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Description</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">The "moat" refers to the structural business qualities that allow a company to generate consistently high returns on capital (ROIC) and maintain high profitability over long periods, protecting it from competition.</p>
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Deep Learning Insight</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">Moats are categorized into five types: 1) Intangible Assets (patents, brand equity, regulatory licenses); 2) Switching Costs (high cost or hassle for customers to switch to a competitor); 3) Network Effects (value increases as more people use it); 4) Cost Advantage (structurally lower production costs); and 5) Efficient Scale (serving a limited market efficiently). The analysis involves assessing the durability and width of the moat. A wide, stable moat is the single greatest predictor of long-term superior investment returns, as it minimizes competition-driven price erosion.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">ROIC measures how effectively a company uses all the capital at its disposal (both debt and equity) to generate profits. It is calculated as: ROIC = Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) / Invested Capital. It is the gold standard for measuring management's efficiency in capital allocation.</p>
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Deep Learning Insight</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">The true test of wealth creation is comparing ROIC to the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). If ROIC &gt; WACC, the company is generating economic value. If ROIC &lt; WACC, the company is destroying value. Investors seek companies that can maintain an ROIC consistently greater than their cost of capital, demonstrating a durable competitive advantage. ROIC should be analyzed over a cycle (5-10 years) to filter out cyclical noise.</p>

Poor Governance is a major red flag, including issues like BOD independence, aggressive accounting policies, or related-party transactions. A high-quality CEO views the retained earnings as capital to be allocated strategically, seeking the highest possible ROIC projects.</p>

Another crucial metric is the Interest Coverage Ratio (EBIT / Interest Expense), which shows how easily a company can meet its interest payments. A low ratio indicates high risk. Optimal leverage is industry-specific; overly high leverage in cyclical industries is a recipe for bankruptcy during downturns.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Relative valuation is a method of determining a company's value by comparing it to the market values of similar, publicly-traded companies. This is done using valuation multiples or ratios, such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Sales (P/S), Price-to-Book (P/B), and Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA).</p>
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Deep Learning Insight</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">No single multiple tells the whole story. A skilled analyst triangulates value using several multiples appropriate for the company's industry and life-cycle stage. For example:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>P/E:</strong> Best for mature, profitable companies. Can be misleading due to accounting choices and non-cash charges.</li>
                <li><strong>P/S:</strong> Useful for valuing growth companies that are not yet profitable. Doesn't account for differences in profitability or debt.</li>
                <li><strong>P/B:</strong> Ideal for capital-intensive industries like banking and insurance, where book value is a good proxy for asset value.</li>
                <li><strong>EV/EBITDA:</strong> The preferred multiple for comparing companies with different capital structures (debt levels) and tax rates, as it is capital-structure-neutral.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">The key is to compare a company's multiples not just to its peers, but also to its own historical average, to determine if it is currently cheap or expensive relative to its own history and its industry.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Understanding the macro backdrop is crucial. Cyclical sectors like Industrials, Materials, and Consumer Discretionary thrive during economic expansions but suffer greatly during contractions. Defensive sectors like Utilities, Healthcare, and Consumer Staples tend to outperform during contractions as their demand is less sensitive to the economic cycle. A top-down analyst first determines the current economic phase to decide which sectors to overweight or underweight before selecting individual stocks.</p>
